To run the file, first compile OverdraftMain.java, then run - 
java OverdraftMain [inputfile] [outputfile]

The input file should be the name file that you want to pass in
The output file should be the name of the file you want to create that shows all changes made to accounts by the system. This file should not currently exist. 

Assumptions - 

The format of the CSV file wont change (this is for setting up the transaction objects)
The data in the CSV file is formatted correctly 
That each transaction starts on a new line in the CSV file. 
The user will only have a savings account and a current account
Both accounts will initialise on 0.
No additional output is needed, however there's a few things it can additionally output such as the balance of the account after processing the files. 
That the input file exists


And thats it! I've tried to comment it thouroughly and have self explanitory names, so all explinations for the classes and functions are in the source code.
